# tools-that-suck

Tool (types) that suck, and why. If any of these get too big they can be moved into their own file.

## Infrastructure and meta-tools

 * reverse proxy & load balancer (VCL is evil and limited without writing C extensions; everything else lacks useful features)
 * an actual way of representing real life documents in a markup language.

## Consumer tools

 * blogging engine
 * calendar (TZ support, recurring events, geo, event planning, overlays -- bring in text/calendar, modify and re-merge changes, CalDAV to output sync. Facebook?)
 * wishlist service

## Developer / more technical tools

 * issue tracking (needs to be out-of-the-box simple, but with a few features missing from eg Github: dependencies, some sort of configurable workflow)
 * wiki
